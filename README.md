# CS-210

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
This project solved the problem of having a list of products and needing to find the frequency of the products mentioned. This project allows for the user to search for product name and receive it's frequency, print out all the products mentioned and their frequency, as well as print out a histogram of all the product's frequencies.  

# What did you do particularly well:
I think that I did a good job of breaking up functions so that one function didn't do too much. I also think I did a good job of cutting down on code redundancy.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure and so on:
I think that if I were to write this project again, I would work in a try/catch as part of the input validation. I think this would be more efficient because I could catch invalid input immediately instead of iterating through and then breaking out of and restarting the for loop if invalid input is caught. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find the most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?:
This was my first time working with maps and I definitely encountered some challenges. A map was perfect for storing this data but I encountered some problems when trying to figure out how to iterate through the map. It didn't work quite like I thought it would and I spent some time researching and trying different ways to iterate through the map. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?:
Skills I learned from this project is practicing working with classes and header files and working with maps. In this course I was introduced to header files for the first time. At first I didn't see the benefit of them, because they felt like they made the code more repetitive, but as projects got bigger I realized how useful header files were. I really enjoy using them now and they help me look deeper into my program's structure and help me try to make my program more efficient and less redundant. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?:
This program is maintainable and adaptable by the use of encapsulation, classes, and the use of functions. What makes this program readable is the use of header files as well as function descriptions and inline comments when needed.
